st.markdown('The NASA GRC Laboratory Infrastructure Data Collection Tool is a web-based application built using Streamlit, an open-source Python framework. The purpose of the tool is to capture the current state of GRC capabilities. This information is necessary to assess the overall state of our infrastructure and assets and will be used to develop strategic plans for laboratory investment. The tool can be accessed via: https://nasagrclabwithlog.streamlit.app/')
st.markdown(' ')
st.markdown('Using the web-app, users should fill out each field for an individual lab and its assets. Assets should only be added to the record if it is associated with the infrastructure of the lab and not the facility. To limit the total number of entries, users should only enter assets that have a value over $50,000 or assets at lower values that are either extremely critical to the labâ€™s capability or are difficult to replace. Entries made by each user can be saved to the database as either a draft or a final submission, such that users can save their work and come back to it to further edit at a later date.')
