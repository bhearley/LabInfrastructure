Laboratory/Capability Name: Structural Dynamics Laboratory
Point of Contact: Vicente Suarez
Branch: Structural Dynamics
Laboratory/Capability Description: The Structural Dynamics Lab (SDL) at NASA Glenn Research Center is the only GRC test lab capable of vibration testing and shock testing hardware for flight qualification. The Structural Dynamics Branch maintains the personnel and expertise needed to conduct testing at the SDL as well as oversee vibration testing, shock testing, modal testing, and model correlation contracted by NASA prime contractors. The SDL supports both NASA space and aeronautics flight hardware customers, however the SDL customer base is not limited to strictly qualifying flight hardware. Research objectives of programs such as In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) have also been recently completed at the SDL. Additionally, the training benefits that the SDL provides to the Structural Dynamics testing discipline at GRC should be included in discussions of lab capability. SDL test engineers both lead and support testing at GRC's Armstrong Test Facility (ATF) Mechanical Vibration Facility (MVF). The Mechanical Vibration Facility is the world's most powerful vibration test facility and it has been shown that the expertise needed for successful testing at the MVF is developed at the Structural Dynamics Lab.

Challenges in sustaining this laboratory/capability: Programs are towards the end of their life-cycle by the time environmental test labs are involved. Due to the short duration in which test labs are involved there is a lack of visibility on the sustainment need of GRC test labs. If the SDL is to maintain full capability outdated equipment and personnel sustainment needs to be addressed.
