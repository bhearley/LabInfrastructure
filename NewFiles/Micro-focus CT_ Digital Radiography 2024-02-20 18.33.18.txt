Laboratory/Capability Name: Micro-focus CT/ Digital Radiography
Point of Contact: Richard Rauser / Richard Martin
Laboratory/Capability Description: The Micro-focus CT/ Digital Radiography laboratory produces high resolution computed tomography (CT) data and digital radiography data of various materials of interest to multiple NASA branches. This is accomplished using 2 system, a 225kV high-resolution system, and a 300kV wide-field system. These systems are able to detect indications such as voids and inclusions down to the 1um level. Data is used to assess material quality, identify manufacturing defects, and monitor damage progression in materials subjected to thermal and mechanical loads.
Laboratory/Capability Website: None.
Challenges in sustaining this laboratory/capability: The CT systems are getting old and potential hardware problems could render the facility useless without a reliable source of support funds. The fact that ASG as a whole does not have a baseline funding stream and must completely depend on the projects to pay their fair share creates issues of getting dollars in time to pay bills such as for WYE's and service contracts, as well as an inability to line up funding for major investments.

Sustainment Funding Source:  We have no level of sustained, baseline funding.  We depend on projects estimating their usage of ASG and building it into their budget requests, or projects paying after using ASG services.

History of capability utilization: The micro-focus CT facility has been instrumental in supporting high-profile, NASA wide projects.  These include inspection and qualification of Sterling Engine components, European Service Module fuel lines and other critical hardware.  The facility also supports much of the metallic and composite materials development effort for the Research and Engineering Directorate. Specifically, the CT facility regularly supports work from LMA, LMC, LMN, and LME.
Major impact and contributions this capability has made possible: A recent major contribution includes the CT inspection of a propellant line for the European Service Module. Cracks detected in the line prevented a major issue with the Artemis-V flight. Additionally, a significant effort has been made in the inspection of Sterling Heater Heads to identify any changes in performance during testing and to assess initial quality.
