Laboratory/Capability Name: ASG - Analytical Chemistry and Thermal Analysis Laboratory
Point of Contact: current, Dereck Johnson (to May 3 2024) - future, Mike Kulis
Branch: LMA
Laboratory/Capability Description: The lab provides total elemental analysis of inorganic materials, mostly alloys and ceramics, from major constituents to ppm level impurities.  It can also provide metals content of certain organic materials.  Carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen can also be determined in inorganic materials, whether present as interstitials or as carbides, nitrides and oxides.  In thermal analysis, heats of transition, specific heat, weight change as a function of temperature, and coefficient of thermal expansion can be determined from room temperature to 1500 C. 
Laboratory/Capability Website: none (website efforts were abandoned in the 2000's)
Challenges in sustaining this laboratory/capability: The infrastructure in Bldg 105 is not always conducive to making precise measurements in this lab, or having continuity of operation.  From condensation or steam valve leaks through the drop ceiling, to electrical power issues, to HVAC room climate problems, to an inoperative elevator, we are having to interrupt work for facilities fixes or come up with workarounds.  The fact that ASG as a whole does not have a baseline funding stream and must completely depend on the projects to pay their fair share creates issues of getting dollars in time to pay bills such as for WYE's and service contracts, as well as an inability to line up funding for major investments.    WRT lab age below, 1992-93 was the last major rehab in this lab, installing new fume hoods and revamping the HVAC and drop ceiling.   In 2018 a partial rehab was done to move equipment in from Bldg 51 and rework a small partition of the lab for thermal analysis space.

Sustainment Funding Source: We have no level of sustained, baseline funding.  We depend on projects estimating their usage of ASG and building it into their budget requests, or projects paying after using ASG services.

History of capability utilization: Pre-pandemic, the Chemical/Thermal analysis lab was used by all of the traditional "materials" branches in LM (LMA, LMC, LME, LMN, some LMT) as well as certain researchers in "structures" branches or those outside the division that may be working with LM staff on a particular project.  Then there is the occasional "mystery" sample from a test that produced an unexpected deposit or coating in the furnace/chamber.  In the return to onsite work era, the customer base has narrowed considerably to where the large majority of projects supported are LMA involved.  Is this coincidence, or is there some reason to think the changes in work culture brought about by the pandemic have had an effect? 
Major impact and contributions this capability has made possible: This lab has provided materials characterization data to help researchers understand the effects of processing parameters, starting material quality, and composition tolerance on the whole materials development enterprise.  This has helped lead to success stories such as the GRCop alloys' use in rocket launches.   In certain cases there are key pieces of data provided that inform the decision as to mission suitability, such as the CTE measurements of depleted uranium-molybdenum alloy for the Kilopower project.
