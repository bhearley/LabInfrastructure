Laboratory/Capability Name: ASG X-ray Diffraction Laboratory
Point of Contact: Rick Rogers
Branch: LMA
Laboratory/Capability Description: The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) lab provided data on the crystalline (or non-crystalline) structure of materials.  Major analysis products are qualitative and quantitative phase ID, residual stress, crystallographic texture, and single crystal orientation.  Multiple hot stages are used for non-ambient data collection.
