Laboratory/Capability Name: Thin Film Sensor Characterization Lab
Point of Contact: John Wrbanek
Branch: LCS
Laboratory/Capability Description: Prototype thin film sensors are treated and characterized in air or vacuum environments up to 1700Â°C.  The characterizations employ practices that have been in use at GRC since 1980. The thin film sensors are typically noble metals, electrolytes, and/or refractory ceramics on substrates of silicon, silicon carbide, quartz, and alumina.
Laboratory/Capability Website: 
Challenges in sustaining this laboratory/capability: Lab is located in the basement fire sprinkler maintenance room.  Fire sprinkler system overflow valve can spray water.  Ceiling vents shed mildew.
