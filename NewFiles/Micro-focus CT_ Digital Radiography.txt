Laboratory/Capability Name: Micro-focus CT/ Digital Radiography
Point of Contact: Richard Rauser / Richard Martin
Laboratory/Capability Description: The Micro-focus CT/ Digital Radiography laboratory produces high resolution computed tomography (CT) data and digital radiography data of various materials of interest to multiple NASA branches. This is accomplished using 2 system, a 225kV high-resolution system, and a 300kV wide-field system. These systems are able to detect indications such as voids and inclusions down to the 1um level. Data is used to assess material quality, identify manufacturing defects, and monitor damage progression in materials subjected to thermal and mechanical loads.
